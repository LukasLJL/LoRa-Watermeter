# Watermeter
To digitalize a watermeter we use [github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device).

## Setup
This folder contains the configuration for the demo, to test the functionality of the LoRa devices. <br>
We refer to the official setup documentation to install it on your esp32-cam -> [documentation](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Installation/). <br>
If you want to have the same demo environment, you can copy the files from this directory to the sd-card and overwrite the defaults.
