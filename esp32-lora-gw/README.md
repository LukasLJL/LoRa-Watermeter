# ESP32-LoRa-Gateway
This is the gateway part which receives lora signals and transforms them into mqtt messages for your internal iot network, like home assistant.

## Setup
To get started, you will need to adjust the secrets for your esp32.
For this you can rename the file `/src/secrets_example.h` to `/src/secrets.h` and adjust the parameters for your environment.
