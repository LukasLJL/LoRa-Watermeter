# LoRa-Watermeter
The Goal of this project is to integrate a watermeter of a house located in the forest.
To digitalize the watermeter we have used [github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device).
To transfer the data over the long distance, weÂ´re using two esp32 with a point-to-point LoRa communication.
